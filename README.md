We can make our DB as queue which process the data in FIFO manner. We can use this with the help of Apache Camel JPA module.

I have created Apache Camel JPA and CXF component with some demo use case for instance, if any row inserted in DB it will take the inserted record and sends to the third party rest API autonomously.
